# Class Diagram

Here is our original [UML Diagram!] (https://github.com/KeithJLZ/csc307-stuffex/blob/main/diagram.md)

# Getting Started

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project root and run `npm install`.

## Frontend Setup

By default, the frontend will connect to the production backend server running on [Azure](https://stuffex.azurewebsites.net/). If you would like to run the frontend with your local development server, change the frontend's `AppConfig.js` such that `backendRoot` is set to `http://localhost:8000` (or whichever port/host you are running a dev server on).

## Backend Setup

To run the backend, you need to set two environment variables. Set `MONGODB_URI` to a connection string with credentials AND specify the stuffex database in the string. You must also set `TOKEN_SECRET` to a string used to hash passwords.

## Running

To run either the frontend or the backend, run `npm run start -w stuffex-frontend` and/or `npm run start -w express-backend`.
